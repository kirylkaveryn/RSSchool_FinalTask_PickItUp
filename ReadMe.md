### **Application idea** 
In this application I want to create an interactive platform for monitoring the amount of pollution of the local environment: forests, fields, rivers, lakes, where monitoring is especially difficult. In simple words - those places outside the cities that we all use. The best people to keep an eye on this area will be the people who live there. And therefore they will be able to permanently monitor and mark the information of illegal dumps on the map, and share this information with the government.

The main feature of the application is that users can not just add dumps objects to the map but also clear them up and make a photo report of the work done. This adds an element of playing a game and increases social responsibility of citizens. A custom mix of pokemon-go, plogging and interactive monitoring. The rating of users who have removed/marked the largest number of landfills will also be kept track of.
The map is publicly available and viewing information about the dumps will be available without user registration. Registration is necessary to clean up the dump on your own and view the statistics.

There are similar application, TrashOut, which allows you to add a dumpsite to the map and inform the government about it. However, the interface is very heavily overloaded with a lot of different elements. And the main feature of this app is reporting to the government. But I want to create an application that will inspire people to make something on their own.

For this application I choose:
- MVVM-C architecture pattern
- Firebase Authentication - for authorization and authentification
- Firebase Database for storage all information about users and dumps
- Firebase Storage for storage dumps photos and users avarars.
